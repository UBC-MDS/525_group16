# DSCI 525 Group 16 Project

authors:  Chen, Ify, Jared, Steffen

As part of the DSCI 525 project we will be building and deploying ensemble Machine Learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~12 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models and the target is the actual rainfall observation.
