# DSCI 525 Group 16 Project

Authors: Chen, Ify, Jared, Steffen

As part of the DSCI 525 project we will be building and deploying ensemble Machine Learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~12 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models and the target is the actual rainfall observation.

## Milestone 1 Notebook

- A Jupyter notebook exploring loading and storing a large dataset in memory directly can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/525_group16/blob/main/notebooks/Milestone1.ipynb)
- A Jupyter notebook getting data from S3 instance and making data ready for machine learning can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/525_group16/blob/main/notebooks/Milestone2.ipynb)
- A folder contains a Python 3 notebook with the code for ML model in scikit-learn, a PySpark notebook with the code for obtaining best hyperparameter settings, and some screenshots can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/525_group16/tree/main/notebooks/milestone3)
- A folder contains a notebook with the solution for developing and deploying API, and some screenshots can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/525_group16/tree/main/notebooks/milestone4)
