# DSCI 525 Group 16 Project

Authors: Chen, Ify, Jared, Steffen

As part of the DSCI 525 project we will be building and deploying ensemble Machine Learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~12 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models and the target is the actual rainfall observation.

## Milestone 1 Notebook

A Jupyter notebook exploring loading and storing a large dataset in memory directly can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/525_group16/blob/main/notebooks/Milestone1.ipynb)
